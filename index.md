### CPSC 120 

* Lab 3

     Lab 3, part 1 was one of my favorite labs to have worked on due to it being about BMR. Prior to have chosen CS I was going into the medical field because numbers like BMI intrested me and being able to have integrated a formula into coding was a fun task to go about it

* Lab 7 
    Lab 7, part 1 is also among my favorite labs to have been able to work on due to it being on of the first that relied on images. Having been able to code something that tells us when parking was and wasn't allowed was fun and challenging because there were many obstacles like having to use military time, having to workound 1-3 signs at a time. It was overall a challenging experience and was able to learn more about the && and || of coding among being able to better read these parking signs.


* Lab 4
    Lab 4, part 1 is ultimately the last of my top 3 favorite labs to have done during my time in Cpsc 120 and it's up there due to the fact that it was the first time other equations played a role into the overall code of it. Let me expand on that, we had to make sure the code was converting milliliters to teaspoons and teaspoons to ounces and the ounces to cups so having had to code these 4 different equations into the code was a challenge and I was able to learn and understand how many ounces went into a cup, etc.
